dfu-util-qda - Quark Microcontroller Device Firmware Upgrade Utility

This is a fork of the dfu-util [1] which is the host side implementation of the
DFU 1.0 [2] and DFU 1.1 [3] specification of the USB forum.

DFU is intended to download and upload firmware to devices connected over
USB. It ranges from small devices like micro-controller boards up to mobile
phones. With dfu-utili-qda you are able to download firmware to your Quark
Microcontroller by using the serial interface (UART).
